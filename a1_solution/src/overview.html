<body>
<p>You are to implement a simple simulation of a building management system (BMS).
    The simulation will be created over the two assignments. In assignment one you
    will implement the classes that make up the core model of the simulation. In
    the second assignment you will implement functionality to evaluate
    hazard levels across multiple sensors, create maintenance schedules for
    rooms on a floor and save and load the state of the system to and from a
    file.
</p>
<p>The simulation has been divided into the packages described below. The classes
    and interfaces you need to implement for the first assignment are described in
    these packages. The second assignment will introduce new packages, classes and
    interfaces.
